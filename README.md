Sorting algorithms 

project1.py file :

This file contains the code. The language it is written is python 3.
Make sure you are in the right file directory.

Commandline execution -  python3 project1.py

-> The program takes input array in two ways.

1. From the user manually.

* Here the user manually enters each number in the array. It takes each number in a new line and generates the array.

Sample input entry - 

Do you want to enter the input? Type Y for yes and N for no : Y

Enter the size of the input : 10

Enter the number you want to add to your array : 2

Enter the number you want to add to your array : 77

Enter the number you want to add to your array : 4

Enter the number you want to add to your array : -2

Enter the number you want to add to your array : 4

Enter the number you want to add to your array : 32

Enter the number you want to add to your array : 6

Enter the number you want to add to your array : 53

Enter the number you want to add to your array : 7

Enter the number you want to add to your array : 8

Your array :  [2, 77, 4, -2, 4, 32, 6, 53, 7, 8]

2. Randomly generates an input for the user.

* Here the user has the specify the size of the array they want , the start range and the end range , I.e if the user wants to generate an input of size 10, and the array is supposed contain any random numbers from 0 to 50.

Sample input entry - 

Do you want to enter the input? Type Y for yes and N for no : N

Enter the size of the input : 10

Enter the start of the range : 0

Enter the end of the range : 50

Your array :  [37, 47, 17, 34, 31, 7, 27, 15, 47, 5]


-> Output of the program :

* After you have given the input array, the program will perform the 7 sorting algorithms on the input array.

* Each algorithm will return the sorted array and the runtime taken to sort that array.
