* Heapsort
 
* Quicksort
 
* Quicksort (Regular quick sort* and quick sort using 3 medians)

* Insertion sort

* Selection sort

* Bubble sort


project1.py file :

This file contains the code. The language it is written is python 3.
Make sure you are in the right file directory.

Commandline execution -  python3 project1.py

-> The program takes input array in two ways.

Do you want to enter the input? Type Y for yes and N for no : 

1. From the user manually.

* Here the user manually enters each number in the array. It takes each number in a new line and generates the array.

2. Randomly generates an input for the user.

* Here the user has the specify the size of the array they want , the start range and the end range , I.e if the user wants to generate an input of size 10, and the array is supposed contain any random numbers from 0 to 50.


-> Output of the program :

* After you have given the input array, the program will perform the 7 sorting algorithms on the input array.

* Each algorithm will return the sorted array and the runtime taken to sort that array.
